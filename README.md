🚀 Excited to share my latest project - a hand tracker click system detector inspired by Apple's vision pro technology! 🖐️💻

I've been working on replicating the pinch-click system using Python and OpenCV. The system accurately tracks hand movements in real-time and detects clicks based on the distance between thumb and index finger tips.

🔍 Key Features:
- Real-time hand tracking using Mediapipe library.
- Pinch-click detection for intuitive interaction.
- Adjustable distance thresholds for personalized use.

💡 This project opens up possibilities for seamless interaction with digital interfaces, especially in applications requiring hands-free or gesture-based control.
